## Project Description

This is my second project using TypeScript in the backend module. It's a small market management app. I've focused on improving my ability to type each function and variable correctly, using type assertion and generics.

### Technologies

- LINUX
- VSCODE
- TYPESCRIPT


### What I Learned

- How to type functions and variable using type assertion
- How to determine what type I'll use when I call a function with generic type
